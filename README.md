###This Python code snippet demonstrates a service with endpoints for handling requests, 
sending results, checking server status, and retrieving request history. 
The service interacts with a database to store request data and external server responses. 

Additionally, the code includes the necessary setup for a Flask app, SQLAlchemy for database interaction, 
and basic endpoint definitions. 
The Dockerfile setup and additional service for emulating an external server are mentioned as 
optional tasks for further development.
